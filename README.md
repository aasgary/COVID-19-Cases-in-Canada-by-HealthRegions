# COVID-19-Cases-in-Canada-by-Health Regions
This repository provides a daily updated point and polygon shapefiles of the COVID-19 cases in Canada based on health regions.  
What we do: 
1. We get the data from: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D6okqtBS3S2NRC7GFVHzaZ67DuTw7LX49-fqSLwJyeo/edit#gid=942958991
2. We adjust and correct the regions names.
3. We geocode the data based on the regions name, province and the country to create a point layer (shapefile).
4. We then aggregate point cases for each health region to create the COVID-19 cases by health regions.
This data is updated daily.
